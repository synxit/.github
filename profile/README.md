# ðŸ‘‹ We are synxit!

The synxit project aims to provide a lightweight zero-knowledge cloud system with secure end-to-end encryption and the ability to securely share and store files, be they calendars, videos or documents. 

We are currently working on a chat system based on the principles of synxit. 

If you are interested in the development, please email: admin@synxit.de
